This approach generatesstrictly feasible iterates by using a new affine scaling transformation and following piecewise linear paths (reflection paths). The interior-reflective approach does not require identification of an ``activity set''. In this paper we establish that the interior-reflective Newton approach is globally and quadratically convergent. Moreover, we develop a specific example of interior-reflective Newton methods which can be used for large-scale and sparse problems.",

The 1:3 scale reinforced concrete frame, the same one used in the first study, was again used for experimental verification. The results show that the retrofit of reinforced concrete structures with friction damping devices can produce satisfactory seismic response. The damping enhancement contributes to the reduction of maximum deformations and only slightly modifies the structural forces transmitted to the foundation.                   ",
