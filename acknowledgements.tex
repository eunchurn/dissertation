My research started with a small curiosity, and the result of my doctoral dissertation was made by a lot of people who helped me for a long time. The meaning of my Ph.D. is that I am an independent researcher trained from the relationship between the professors, the doctors, and the members of the laboratory. Now, as an independent researcher, no matter what problem I am given (even if they are problems besides the subject I have studied for many years), I think I have the ability to make a hypothesis, think logically, and gain insight through mathematical thinking experiments or actual physical experiments and data. I am grateful to those who have helped me to have such logical and critical thinking ability, problem-solving abilities, and collaboration skills with other researchers. 

First of all, I would like to thank Professor Kyung-Won Min, my advisor, for his friendly support, valuable guidance, endless patience, and adequate supervision through the course of this study. During my undergraduate years, he led me to graduate school and gave me a lot of support and various research fields for my master's and doctoral studies. He helped me find out what only I can do for myself as a researcher, not what anyone can do; he has trained me to have a passion that I did not have. Also, I would like to express my gratitude for the care he has given to my studies and my career. I would like to thank my committee chair, Professor Sang-Hyun Lee, who has the attitude and the substance of a genius: he continually and convincingly conveyed a spirit of adventure regarding research and scholarship, and the excitement in doing research. I was able to learn from his genius of critical thinking ability, adventurous spirit, challenge, enthusiasm and attitude toward research. And he always shared a common respect with me and gave me philosophy and insights in various fields other than academic studies. I would like to thank my committee member, Professor Junhee Kim who kindly welcomed me and carefully reviewed my thesis to give me the result of my dissertation. He also gave insights on the current status of academic studies and numerous works of literature to help us advance toward future researchers. I thank another one of my committee members, Professor Sung-Kyung Lee, who gave me almost every idea of my dissertation and gave me generous advice and support so that I could realize it. He carried out the experiment together with me, took care of all the details that I could have missed, and gave me a look at this thesis from the beginning to the end. I would like to thank the last but by no means the least my committee members, Professor Ji-Hun Park, who was a role model of the researcher who did not spare any advice on research methodology during the master's course and showed me how to do research through logical and critical thinking skills and to deliver the results. Currently, I am trying to get an impression of attitudes toward scholarship based on Professor Park's numerous research articles. 

I was assisted by many professors from the Department of Architectural Engineering until I started my degree program at the department at Dankook University and got my doctorate. In particular, Professor Lan Chung's excellent lectures during my undergraduate years have given me a lot of interest in architecture and structural engineering, and the curiosity he inspired has made me researcher. Also, during my graduate school years, he has been devoted to student interest and support and has helped me to have a passion for experimentation and research. This thesis could not have been completed without his support toward `SRRC(Seismic Retrofitting \& Remodeling Research Center)' and `Structural Analysis \& Dynamics Laboratory'. I would like to thank Professor Hway-Suh Kim who has taught me about the philosophy and passion of studying about the global trends in architectural engineering since my undergraduate years. I would like to thank Professor Jae-Yeol Chun. During his undergraduate lectures, I was able to broaden my discipline on value engineering, and I learned the philosophy of communication and management skills among engineers in architectural engineering projects. I also would like to thank Professor Chee-Kyung Kim, who is the head of the department, and Professor Hyeon-Jun Moon, who broadened my mathematical knowledge about probability, Professor Tae-Won Park, Professor Kyung-Koo Lee and Professor Tae-Sung Eom.

My gratitude is also extended to Professor Eunjong Yu of `Hanyang University', Professor Hongjin Kim of `Kyungpook National University', Professor Jae-Seung Hwang of `Chonnam National University', Professor Kyung-Soo Kang of `Tongmyong University', Dr. Seok-Jun Joo of `TE Solution' who gave many ideas and advice to this paper, Dr. Jin-Wook Joung of `Daewoo Construction Technology Research Institute', Dr. Byoung-Wook Moon of `Hyundai Engineering \& Construction Research Institute' who are my seniors in the laboratory and encouraged me a lot, Dr. Sung-Sik Woo, who is my senior in the department and has given much attention and helped me a lot with the experiment, Professor Chung-Bang Yun and Professor Hyung-Jo Jung of `KAIST' who gave a lot of advice in various academic conferences. Further appreciation is extended to Hyoung-Seop Kim, Myoung-Kyu Lee, Sang-Hoon Kang, Roo-Jee Lee, Kyung-Jo Youn, Jae-Sung Heo, Hee-San Chung, Ji-Young Seong, Hye-Ri Lee and all alumni of `Structural Analysis \& Dynamics Laboratory'; I was able to complete my studies with the help of all the graduates. I also thank Yoon-Soo Shin, who helped me a lot in the process of dissertation review, and Jae-Yoon Bae, assistant manager, who helped me with administrative tasks. I thank Mr. Chung-Ki Choi, the representative of `S.H. Technology \& Policy Institute', Dr. Mi-Yun Park, Dr. Wan-Soon Park who gave me consideration in preparing dissertation even if there was a lot of work to do, my colleagues, Byung-Gyu Moon and Jeonghoon Lee, who helped me a lot with my work. I would also like to thank Dr. Se-Gon Kwon and Sungbaek Park of Korea Railroad Corporation for encouraging me greatly, Hyung-Goo Kang, Dr. Jung-Gon Kim, and Dr. Won-Yong Koo who helped me a lot in business and research. I would like to express my sincere appreciation to Professor Hosin David Lee of `The University of Iowa', who has always been open minded to listen to my story and help me to discuss and develop a lot of research issues.

I would like to thank numerous people who encouraged and inspired my other abilities besides research, Yong-Hyun Lee(eAeon) of `MOT', Tae-Sang Cho and Young-Sang Cho(Jowall) of `Byul.org', Hyo-Sun Cha of `Trampauline', photographer Suk-Kuhn Oh, Juno Lee of `Casker', musician and journalist Yongmin Moon(mimyo), Toby Hwang and Annie Ko of `LOVEXSTEREO', SHEEAN and Sang Park, Wuhyun Hyun(St. Void) and Yonhee Wu, Min-Hun Yoon(HAVAQQUQ) of `Young, Gifted\&Wack', Ji-Han Jeon of `Peterpan Complex', in particular, Jeong-Eun Bae(Zieum) who has waited for me to make music for a long time as a team of `SARAM12SARAM'. My gratitude is also extended to Sang-Hyuk Haan, -fashion designer, CEO, and founder of `HEICH ES HEICH',-who has been working together on the runway for many years and made me feel alive, photographer Sukmu Yoon, Juhyun Cho, Yoonha Ju of `Vodka Rain' who maximized my potential. I would like to thank In-Sang Chang, Ho-Sang Lee, and Myoung-Won Lee for being old friends for over 20 years. I am grateful to everyone who knows me. Finally, I wish to express my love and gratitude for my wife Inkyung Baik, and her family. Also, I am greatly indebted to my parents and my brother for their love and support.
