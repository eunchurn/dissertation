I would like to express deepest appreciation to my advisor, Professor Kyung-Won Min for his friendly support, valuable guidance, endless patience, and constructive supervision through the course of this study. Thanks are also extended to my committee chair Professor Sang-Hyun Lee, who has the attitude and the substance of a genius: he continually and convincingly conveyed a spirit of adventure in regard to research and scholarship, and an excitement in regard to teaching. Without his guidance and persistent help this dissertation would not have been possible. I would like to thank my committee members, Professor Junhee Kim, Professor Ji-Hun Park and Professor Sung-Kyung Lee, whose work demonstrated to me that concern for global affairs supported by an “engagement” in comparative literature and modern technology, should always transcend academia and provide a quest for our times.
